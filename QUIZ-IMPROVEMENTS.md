# AI Readiness Quiz Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the AI Readiness Quiz to enhance SEO, server component usage, and testing infrastructure.

## SEO Optimizations

### 1. Structured Metadata Approach

- Created a centralized metadata generation system in `src/lib/metadata.ts`
- Implemented consistent metadata across the entire site
- Added dynamic metadata generation based on quiz results
- Included proper page titles, descriptions, and OpenGraph data

### 2. Structured Data Implementation

- Implemented FAQ schema for quiz questions
- Created article schema for content pages
- Enhanced discoverability for search engines

### 3. Canonical URLs

- Added proper canonical URL support in metadata
- Ensured consistent URL structure for all pages

## Server Component Implementation

### 1. Page Structure Improvements

- Converted static content to server components
- Created `QuizIntro` as a server component
- Kept client components only where needed for interactivity
- Implemented proper Suspense boundaries

### 2. Hybrid Architecture

- Established clear client/server boundaries
- Used server components for initial rendering
- Maintained client components for interactive elements
- Improved initial page load performance

### 3. Dynamic Metadata Generation

- Implemented server-side metadata generation
- Added route-based dynamic metadata support
- Enhanced SEO with server-rendered metadata

## Testing Infrastructure

### 1. Jest Configuration

- Set up Jest with Next.js support
- Configured proper module resolution
- Added snapshot testing capability
- Implemented test environment with JSDOM

### 2. Component Testing

- Created unit tests for UI components
- Added accessibility testing support
- Implemented component snapshot tests

### 3. Mocking

- Set up Next.js navigation mocks
- Created Image component mocks
- Added environment variable mocking

## Accessibility Improvements

- Enhanced keyboard navigation
- Added proper ARIA attributes
- Improved screen reader support
- Implemented proper semantic HTML

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Test Coverage**

   - Add tests for all components
   - Implement integration tests for the quiz flow
   - Add E2E tests with Cypress or Playwright

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implement Lighthouse CI
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals
   - Optimize image loading strategies

3. **Advanced Server Components**
   - Move more data fetching to server
   - Implement server actions for form handling
   - Optimize component tree for hydration
